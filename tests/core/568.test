# For issue #568.  Before the patch implemented for #568, running
# simulation-based reduction on automata with many APs was getting
# exponentially slow even if few different labels were used.
#
# For instance we had this:
#
# % genaut --cycle-onehot=10..20 --name='size %L' |
#   autfilt --small --stats='%M: %S->%s in %r seconds'
# size 10: 100->10 in 0.0395407 seconds
# size 11: 121->11 in 0.0950484 seconds
# size 12: 144->12 in 0.227828 seconds
# size 13: 169->13 in 0.391545 seconds
# size 14: 196->14 in 0.954784 seconds
# size 15: 225->15 in 2.34656 seconds
# size 16: 256->16 in 5.80549 seconds
# size 17: 289->17 in 14.3545 seconds
# size 18: 324->18 in 47.1589 seconds
# size 19: 361->19 in 138.023 seconds
#
# The test below shows that even with --cycle-onehot-nba=80 we don't
# have any problem now.
